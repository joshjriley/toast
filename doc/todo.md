# todo
- Implement cadence
- Implement runs
- instrument switch incompatibility (ie LRIS/MOSFIRE)
- schedule scoring
- real queries for program data and shutdown data
- real query for moon phases
- Airmass, target scoring
- force small portions to different days (ie avoid same program on same night for 1/2 and 1/4)
- Deal with instrument base config info (ie HIRESr and HIRESb are both base HIRES)
- Deal with multi instrument selection (ie NIRC2+NIRESPEC)
- Consider a sequential approach instead of random?


# questions: 
- The "Cadence" form seems like a misnomer since it is really only for selecting exact dates.  Should it say "Cadence/Exact Dates"?
- Whats up with Subaru instrument selects?


# coversheet form changes needed:
- Make it clear not to put dates in the special request field. (parse for them and warn)?
- Make it clear that HST is used throughout.  Where was it that Carolyn said UT date was used?
