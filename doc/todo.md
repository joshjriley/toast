# now
- Airmass API?
- Airmass, target scoring
- Deal with instrument base config info (ie HIRESr and HIRESb are both base HIRES)
- Deal with multi instrument selection (ie NIRC2+NIRESPEC)
- Whats up with Subaru instrument selects?
- Should we assume if they put an "X" in a moon date range but didn't list individual dates below that they don't want the entire date range?



# misc
- look into "Job Shop Problem"
- find Airmass calc api or python code
